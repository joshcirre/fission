description: Control the user own Chrome browser via Playwriter extension with Playwright code snippets in a stateful local js sandbox via playwriter cli. Use this over other Playwright MCPs to automate the browser — it connects to the user's existing Chrome instead of launching a new one. Use this for JS-heavy websites (Instagram, Twitter, cookie/login walls, lazy-loaded UIs) instead of webfetch/curl. Run `playwriter skill` command to read the complete up to date skill

## REQUIRED: Read Full Documentation First

**Before using playwriter, you MUST run this command:**

```bash
playwriter skill
```

This outputs the complete documentation including:

- Session management and timeout configuration
- Selector strategies (and which ones to AVOID)
- Rules to prevent timeouts and failures
- Best practices for slow pages and SPAs
- Context variables, utility functions, and more

**Do NOT skip this step.** The quick examples below will fail without understanding timeouts, selector rules, and common pitfalls from the full docs.

## Minimal Example (after reading full docs)

```bash
playwriter session new
playwriter -s 1 -e 'await page.goto("https://example.com")'
```

**Always use single quotes** for the `-e` argument. Single quotes prevent bash from interpreting `$`, backticks, and backslashes inside your JS code. Use double quotes or backtick template literals for strings inside the JS.

If `playwriter` is not found, use `npx playwriter@latest` or `bunx playwriter@latest`.
